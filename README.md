===========

My name is Richard Welsh and I have always been interested in programming. I love how it takes the theoretical and so directly transforms it into the practical. I've been in and out of school, and I don't currently have a job or career in development, but I still want to pursue one, and I am determined to finish school and do exactly that. I also want to start writing code in my own spare time to aid in these endeavors, which is why I've signed up for GitHub and am going to start using http://www.exercism.io to practice.
